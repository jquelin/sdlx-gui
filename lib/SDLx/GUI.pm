# ABSTRACT: Create GUI easily with SDL

1;
__END__

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SDL> is great to create nifty games, except it's cumbersome to write
a usable GUI with it... Unfortunately, almost all games do have some
part that needs buttons and checkboxes and stuff (think configuration
screens).

This module eases the pain, by providing a L<Tk>-like way of building a
GUI.
